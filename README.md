Read-only first RSS/Atom feed reader made for [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org) meant to be as simple and straight-forward as possible, and, 
as this is a changelog-first reader, it purposefully does not contain common features on RSS readers, like "read" articles, favorites, and others.

## Todo
